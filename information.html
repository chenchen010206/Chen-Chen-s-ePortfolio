		<h2>My Hometown</h2>
		<p>I come from Kuching, the capital of Sarawak, Malaysia, a city known for its unique charm, rich culture, and beautiful landscapes. Often called the “Cat City”, Kuching is a place where history, nature, and modern development blend harmoniously.</p>
		<p>The city is famous for its delicious local food, such as Sarawak laksa, kolo mee, and kek lapis. It is also home to stunning riverside views, vibrant markets, and historical landmarks like the Sarawak River Waterfront and Fort Margherita. Surrounded by lush greenery, including national parks and wildlife sanctuaries, Kuching is a gateway to exploring Borneo’s natural beauty.</p>
		<p>Beyond its attractions, what makes Kuching truly special is its friendly and welcoming people. The city’s peaceful atmosphere and strong sense of community make it a wonderful place to live and grow. No matter where I go, Kuching will always be my home.</p>
