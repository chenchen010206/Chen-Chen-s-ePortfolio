    <p>​During my secondary school years from 2014 to 2018, I was an active member of the Kuching Town School Band, playing the clarinet. Throughout this period, I took on several leadership roles, including Assistant Woodwind Leader, Woodwind Leader, and Secretary. My dedication was recognized with the Best Girl Award, which I was honored to receive twice.</p>
    <p>I participated in numerous performances, such as the annual school orientation and sports day events, where we welcomed new students and energized the crowd. Additionally, I performed in the yearly Wesak Day parade, contributing to the cultural celebrations. In 2016, I had the privilege of representing our band at the National Youth Day (Hari Belia Negara) celebration, a significant event organized by Malaysia's Ministry of Youth and Sports to honor the contributions of young people to the nation.</p>
    <p>Being part of the Kuching Town School Band not only enhanced my musical abilities but also instilled in me valuable lessons in leadership, teamwork, and discipline. These experiences have left an indelible mark on my personal growth and development.</p>

        <p>Our project was conducted at SMK Wira Penrissen, where we delivered finance-related knowledge to the students. Through interactive sessions and activities, we aimed to enhance their understanding of financial concepts, equipping them with essential skills for managing personal finances and making informed financial decisions.</p>
        <p>This experience not only allowed me to apply my academic knowledge in a practical setting but also strengthened my leadership, teamwork, and communication skills. It was a rewarding opportunity to contribute to the community while gaining valuable hands-on experience.</p>
